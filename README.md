# REC-GUI
Real-time Experimental Control with Graphical User Interface, created by the Rosenberg Lab at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 

Modern neuroscience research often requires the coordination of multiple processes such as stimulus generation, real-time experimental control, as well as behavioral and neural measurements. The technical demands required to simultaneously manage these processes with high temporal fidelity limits the number of labs capable of performing such work. Here we present an open-source network-based parallel processing framework that lowers this barrier. The Real-Time Experimental Control with Graphical User Interface (REC-GUI) Framework offers multiple advantages, including: (i) a modular design that is agnostic to coding language(s) and operating system(s) to maximize experimental flexibility and minimize researcher effort, (ii) simple interfacing to connect multiple measurement and recording devices, (iii) high temporal fidelity by dividing task demands across CPUs, and (iv) real-time control using a fully customizable and intuitive GUI. We present applications for human, non-human primate, and rodent studies which collectively demonstrate that the REC-GUI Framework facilitates technically demanding, behavior-contingent neuroscience research. Sample code and hardware configurations are downloadable, and future developments will be released.

Tutorials for learning how to use the software are provided in the Documentation folder. Video tutorials accompanying  the documentation can be found on our YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWqf4wJ5WSkHNhsvKUcmt0A).

## Updates:
20 May 2020: REC-GUI now supports both Python2 and Python3. The main difference involves how data is sent/received between the GUI and MATLAB computers.
